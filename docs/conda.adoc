== Conda

`conda` is a family of package managers originally used for `Python` packages.
The original motivation was for `Python` packages which 
wrapped libraries not written in `python`.
Since that time `conda` has evolved away from its `python` origins.
The version used here, `micromamba`, contains no python.

Generally, `conda` creates environments.
A `conda` environment provides packages and environment variables.
